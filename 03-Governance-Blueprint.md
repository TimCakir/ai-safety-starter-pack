## Executive Summary

**Why This Policy Exists:**

At [COMPANY NAME], we recognize that AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot can dramatically improve productivity, creativity, and efficiency. However, without proper governance, they also create significant risks to our data security, client confidentiality, regulatory compliance, and intellectual property.

**The Reality:**
- Italy fined OpenAI ‚Ç¨15 million for GDPR violations in December 2024
- Samsung experienced three separate data leaks in 20 days due to employees sharing code with ChatGPT
- 38% of employees at companies like ours share confidential data with AI tools without approval

**Our Approach:**

We will NOT ban AI tools. Bans don't work‚Äîthey drive usage underground and create more risk. Instead, we're establishing clear boundaries that let you use AI productively while protecting what matters most: our clients, our data, and our reputation.

**Bottom Line:**
- Use approved AI tools for appropriate work tasks
- Never share confidential, restricted, or client data
- Follow department-specific rules for your role
- Ask if you're unsure‚Äîwe're here to help, not punish

   - PUBLIC = Lower severity
   - INTERNAL = Moderate severity
   - CONFIDENTIAL = High severity
   - RESTRICTED = Maximum severity

2. **Intent:** Was the violation intentional or accidental?
   - Accidental (didn't know rule) = Lower severity
   - Negligent (should have known) = Moderate severity
   - Intentional (knowingly violated) = Maximum severity

3. **Harm:** What was the actual or potential impact?
   - No harm, no exposure = Lower severity
   - Potential harm, contained quickly = Moderate severity
   - Actual harm, client impact, regulatory violation = Maximum severity

4. **Pattern:** Is this a first offense or repeated violation?
   - First offense = Applied tier
   - Repeated offense = Escalation to next tier

**Aggravating Factors (may escalate tier):**
- Attempting to hide or cover up the violation
- Violating after explicit warning or training
- Violation affects clients, partners, or third parties
- Violation triggers regulatory reporting obligations
- Employee holds elevated access or security clearance

**Mitigating Factors (may reduce tier):**

### What Triggers an Investigation

The following activities may trigger a policy violation investigation:

üö® **Automatic Alerts:**
- Large file uploads to unapproved AI tool domains
- Attempted access to blocked AI tools after prior warning
- Clipboard activity containing data patterns matching Restricted data (SSNs, credit cards, API keys)
- Use of unapproved AI tools from company networks

‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual Review Triggers:**
- Manager or colleague reports suspected policy violation
- Client or partner raises concern about potential data exposure
- Routine audit uncovers high AI usage volumes or unusual patterns
- Employee self-reports potential violation

üìä **Risk Scoring Triggers:**
- Employee with access to Restricted data uses AI tools frequently
- Unusual times (late night, weekends) combined with large data transfers
- Pattern of accessing confidential files followed by AI tool usage

**False Positive Protections:**
- Automated alerts reviewed by IT Security before employee notification
- Context considered (e.g., PUBLIC data upload may resemble CONFIDENTIAL pattern)
- Multiple data points required before formal investigation initiated

---

### Enforcement Authority

**Policy Enforcement Roles:**

| Role | Authority |
|------|-----------|
| **IT Security Team** | Monitors AI usage, investigates violations, determines initial violation tier |
| **Human Resources** | Conducts employee interviews, implements disciplinary actions, maintains violation records |
| **Legal Department** | Advises on regulatory notification requirements, reviews Tier 3 violations, assesses legal liability |
| **Department Managers** | Notifies employees of violations, conducts follow-up check-ins, reinforces policy compliance |
| **AI Governance Committee** | Reviews policy effectiveness, approves new AI tools, adjudicates appeals |
| **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)** | Final authority on Tier 2/3 violations, policy updates, and tool approvals |

**Escalation Path:**
1. IT Security detects potential violation ‚Üí Investigates ‚Üí Determines initial tier
2. HR notified ‚Üí Conducts employee interview ‚Üí Confirms violation tier with CISO
3. Manager notified ‚Üí Implements disciplinary action ‚Üí Documents in employee file
4. Legal notified (if Tier 2/3) ‚Üí Assesses notification requirements ‚Üí Oversees client/regulatory communication
5. Employee may appeal to AI Governance Committee within 10 business days

---

### Employee Self-Reporting

**We encourage self-reporting of accidental violations.**

If you accidentally violate this policy (e.g., realized after the fact that you shared confidential data with an AI tool), **immediately**:

1. **Stop using the tool** and do not delete evidence
2. **Notify your manager and IT Security** at [security@companyname.com]
3. **Document what data was shared** (classification, approximate scope, time/date)
4. **Cooperate with investigation** and provide complete information

**Self-Reporting Benefits:**
- May reduce violation tier (e.g., Tier 2 reduced to Tier 1)
- Demonstrates good faith and commitment to compliance
- Allows [COMPANY NAME] to respond quickly and minimize harm
- Shows accountability and responsibility

**Self-Reporting Does Not Guarantee No Consequences:**
- Severe violations (Tier 3 with significant harm) may still result in termination
- Legal or regulatory obligations (e.g., breach notification) still apply
- Client notification may still be required

**Example:**
- Engineer realizes they accidentally pasted a proprietary function into ChatGPT while debugging. They immediately stop, notify manager and IT Security, and provide details. Original violation would be Tier 3 (Restricted data = trade secret code), but self-reporting and cooperation reduce it to Tier 2 (suspension + retraining) instead of termination.

# About This Framework

**The Governance Blueprint** is based on 500+ enterprise AI audits conducted by Tim Cakir and incorporates lessons learned from:

- Italy's ‚Ç¨15 million GDPR fine against OpenAI (December 2024)
- Samsung's three data leak incidents from employee ChatGPT usage
- 38% employee shadow AI usage study (CybSafe "Oh, Behave!" Report 2024)
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- OWASP GenAI Security Project guidelines
- ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management Systems standards

**Key Insights Incorporated:**

1. **68% Hide AI Use:** Employees hide AI usage because they fear punishment. This policy creates transparency through reasonable rules.

2. **50% Would Defy Bans:** Banning AI doesn't work‚Äîit drives usage underground. This policy enables AI use with guardrails.

3. **30-Minute Deployment:** Policy designed for rapid implementation without requiring extensive legal review or customization.

4. **Progressive Discipline:** Three-tier system prioritizes education over termination, reducing fear while maintaining accountability.

5. **Department-Specific Rules:** Generic policies fail because risks differ by role. Tailored rules for Legal, HR, Finance, Engineering, Sales, and Marketing.
