# The Communication Templates
## Ready-to-Send Announcements for AI Policy Rollout

---

## Introduction: Why Communication Makes or Breaks AI Governance

**The brutal truth:** 68% of employees hide their AI tool usage. Another 38% actively share confidential company data with AI tools without approval.

Your AI policy can be perfectly written, legally airtight, and technically sound‚Äîbut if your team doesn't understand it, believe in it, or feel empowered by it, you're just creating paperwork while risk accumulates in the shadows.

**This changes today.**

These seven communication templates transform AI governance from a compliance checkbox into a cultural shift. Each template is designed to be copied, customized with your company details, and sent‚Äîturning hours of communication development into minutes of thoughtful personalization.

### What You'll Find Here

1. **All-Hands Policy Rollout Announcement** - The CEO message that sets the strategic tone
2. **Department-Specific Guidelines** (5 variations) - Making policy relevant for Legal, HR, Finance, Engineering, and Sales
3. **Training Session Invitation** - Engaging employees in mandatory education
4. **First Violation Warning** (Tier 1) - Educational, supportive response to first incidents
5. **Second Violation Notice** (Tier 2) - Serious escalation with clear consequences
6. **New Tool Approval Request** - Employee template for proposing new AI tools
7. **Monthly AI Usage Summary** - Leadership dashboard for ongoing governance

### How to Use These Templates

**Step 1: Read through all templates first** - Understanding the full communication arc helps maintain consistent messaging.

**Step 2: Customize [PLACEHOLDERS]** - Every template includes bracketed placeholders like [COMPANY NAME] and [TRAINING DATE]. Replace these with your specific information.

**Step 3: Adjust tone for your culture** - Each template includes tone guidance, but your company culture should guide final adjustments. Startups can be more casual; enterprises more formal.

**Step 4: Get legal/HR review** - Especially for violation notices and policy announcements, have your legal and HR teams review before sending.

**Step 5: Deploy in sequence** - The templates are ordered for optimal rollout timing. Don't send violation notices before announcing the policy!

### The Tim Cakir Methodology Embedded in These Templates

Every template reflects three core principles:

1. **Transparency over surveillance** - We explain *why* policies exist, not just *what* they are. This builds trust instead of triggering resistance.

2. **Enabling over restricting** - Language emphasizes approved alternatives and support, not what's forbidden. We're giving teams better tools, not taking away capabilities.

3. **Education over punishment** - Violation responses start supportive and escalate only when necessary. First-time mistakes are learning opportunities, not disciplinary events.

**Email Body:**

Team,

AI tools have become essential to how we work‚Äîand that's not changing. What *is* changing is how we ensure you can use them safely, legally, and effectively.

**Why we're implementing an AI governance policy:**

In the past 18 months, we've seen a 485% increase in corporate data flowing into AI tools across our industry. While this drives productivity, it also creates real risks:

- **Regulatory exposure:** A major tech company received a ‚Ç¨15 million GDPR fine in 2024 for improper AI data handling
- **Data leaks:** [COMPETITOR/PEER COMPANY] had confidential information exposed through unmanaged AI tool usage
- **Compliance requirements:** [IF APPLICABLE: Our enterprise clients increasingly require documented AI governance]

We're not implementing this policy to restrict your work‚Äîwe're doing it to give you *better* tools with proper security.

**What's changing:**

Starting [EFFECTIVE DATE], [COMPANY NAME] has approved specific AI tools for company work:
- [APPROVED TOOL 1] - For [use case]
- [APPROVED TOOL 2] - For [use case]
- [APPROVED TOOL 3] - For [use case]

You can view the full approved tool list here: [LINK TO POLICY/APPROVED TOOLS]

**What you need to do:**

1. **Review the policy** at [LINK] (10-minute read)
2. **Attend mandatory training** on [TRAINING DATE RANGE] - Calendar invites coming this week
3. **Transition to approved tools** for any work involving company information by [DEADLINE DATE]
4. **Request new tools** through our simple approval process if you need something not on our list

**Want to propose a new AI tool?** We've created a streamlined approval process. If there's a tool that would help you work better, we want to evaluate it. Details in the full policy.

**Questions?**
- Policy questions: [POLICY EMAIL/SLACK CHANNEL]
- Technical support: [IT SUPPORT CONTACT]
- Anonymous feedback: [ANONYMOUS FEEDBACK FORM LINK]

Our goal is simple: Give you the most powerful AI tools available while protecting [COMPANY NAME], our clients, and your careers from preventable risks.

Let's build the future responsibly.

### Template: First Violation Warning

**Subject:** AI Policy Guidance: Let's Talk About [TOOL NAME / INCIDENT]

---

**Email Body:**

Hi [EMPLOYEE NAME],

I wanted to reach out about your recent use of [SPECIFIC AI TOOL / DESCRIBE INCIDENT] on [DATE]. This is a friendly heads-up, not a formal disciplinary action‚Äîbut we need to make sure you have the right tools and information to stay compliant with our AI policy going forward.

**What happened:**

On [DATE], we noticed [SPECIFIC VIOLATION - e.g., "you used [UNAUTHORIZED TOOL] to [action]" or "company confidential information was inputted into an unapproved AI tool"].

**Why this matters:**

[EXPLAIN SPECIFIC RISK - choose appropriate reason]:
- This tool doesn't have the enterprise security controls we need to protect company data
- The information shared included [CONFIDENTIAL DATA TYPE], which creates [LEGAL/SECURITY/COMPLIANCE RISK]
- This tool's data retention policy means the information may be stored indefinitely outside our control

**Here's what we need you to do:**

1. ‚úÖ **Stop using [UNAUTHORIZED TOOL] for company work** immediately
2. ‚úÖ **Transition to [APPROVED ALTERNATIVE TOOL]** - I can help you get set up if needed
3. ‚úÖ **Review the AI policy** (if you haven't already): [LINK TO POLICY]
4. ‚úÖ **Attend AI policy training** (if missed): [LINK TO SCHEDULE MAKEUP SESSION]

**Need help?**

- If [APPROVED ALTERNATIVE] doesn't meet your needs, let's talk about requesting the tool you prefer through our approval process: [LINK TO TOOL REQUEST FORM]
- If you're not sure whether something is confidential, check with [MANAGER / SECURITY TEAM / DATA CLASSIFICATION GUIDE LINK]
- If you have questions about the policy, I'm here to help: [CONTACT METHOD]

**What happens next:**

This is your first notice, which is educational only‚Äîno formal documentation in your employee file. If we see continued use of unapproved tools or handling of confidential data in violation of the policy, we'll need to escalate to a formal written warning.

I know policy changes can be frustrating, especially when you've found a tool that works well for you. Our goal is to help you work efficiently *and* securely. Let's find a solution that does both.

**Questions or concerns?**
Let's chat: [MANAGER PHONE / EMAIL / SCHEDULE 1:1 LINK]

[MANAGER NAME]
[TITLE]

---

**Customization Notes:**
- **Be specific about violation:** Vague "you violated the policy" doesn't help. Specify exactly what tool, what action, what data.
- **Explain the actual risk:** Don't just say "security risk." Explain: "This tool stores data indefinitely and could be subpoenaed in legal proceedings" or "This tool's free version may use company data for AI training."
- **Offer alternatives immediately:** Don't just say "stop doing X." Say "stop X, start using Y instead, here's how to get access."
- **Document privately:** Never send violation notices to groups or CC others unnecessarily. This is private feedback.

**Tone Guidance:**
- Start with "I wanted to reach out" not "You violated policy"
- Use "we noticed" not "you were caught"
- Frame as "here's what we need you to do" not "you must comply"
- End with offer to help, not threat of consequences
- Assume good intent‚Äîmost violations are accidental

**Legal/HR Review Required:** Yes - Have your employment counsel review this template before use, especially the language about documentation and escalation.

---

## Template 5: Second Violation Notice (Tier 2)

**Purpose:** Serious escalation for repeat violations after educational warning, documenting formal consequences and clear expectations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### About These Templates

**Q: Can I modify the templates to match our company tone?**
A: Absolutely. These templates are starting points. Adjust formality, add humor if appropriate for your culture, include company-specific terminology, and make them your own.

**Q: Do I need to use all seven templates?**
A: The first three (All-Hands, Department Guidelines, Training Invitation) are essential. The violation templates (4 & 5) are critical to have ready even if you hope to never use them. The tool request (6) and monthly summary (7) can be adapted or skipped for very small organizations.

**Q: How do I know if my customizations are effective?**
A: Track email open rates, click-through rates on links, question volume, and training attendance. High engagement indicates effective communication. If metrics are low, adjust tone, timing, or delivery method.

**Q: Should these be emails or another format?**
A: Email is most common and easiest to track, but consider:
- All-hands announcement: Email + live meeting + Slack post for visibility
- Department guidelines: Email + team meeting discussion
- Training invitation: Email + calendar invite + Slack reminders
- Violation notices: Always email (creates documented record)

### About Implementation

**Q: How long does rollout typically take?**
A: 4-6 weeks for initial rollout (announcement through training completion). Ongoing governance is continuous. Rushed rollouts (<2 weeks) tend to have lower compliance; extended rollouts (>8 weeks) lose momentum.

**Q: What if employees resist the policy?**
A: Resistance usually stems from: (1) Perception of restriction vs enablement - re-emphasize approved tools and benefits; (2) Insufficient alternatives - fast-track tool requests from vocal resisters; (3) Unclear "why" - double down on real incident examples and risk explanation.

**Q: Do we need to monitor employee AI usage?**
A: Not necessarily. Some companies deploy monitoring tools (Teramind, Harmonic Security), others rely on spot checks and self-reporting. Monitoring increases compliance but can hurt trust. Start with education; add monitoring only if violations persist.

**Q: What if someone violates the policy before training?**
A: No enforcement before training is completed (or at minimum, training opportunity offered). You can't hold people accountable for policies they haven't been taught. Document the incident, accelerate their training, then begin enforcement clock.

### About Violations

**Q: When do I send Tier 1 vs Tier 2 warnings?**
A: **Tier 1** is always for first-time violations (educational). **Tier 2** is for repeat violations after Tier 1 warning. Exception: Egregious violations (e.g., intentionally sharing trade secrets, malicious data theft) skip to Tier 2 or higher immediately.

**Q: What if a high-performer or executive violates the policy?**
A: Policy applies to everyone equally. Selective enforcement destroys credibility and creates legal liability. Senior people should receive the same Tier 1 educational warning as anyone else. (In practice, brief their manager first as a courtesy.)

**Q: How do we discover violations without surveillance?**
A: Common detection methods: (1) IT reviews enterprise tool logs; (2) Employees self-report or ask questions that reveal violations; (3) Data loss prevention (DLP) tools flag unusual data movement; (4) Optional: Browser-based monitoring tools. Don't need to catch everything‚Äîconsistent enforcement of detected violations creates deterrent effect.

**Q: What if someone refuses to transition to approved tools?**
A: This is insubordination, not just a policy violation. After Tier 1 warning, if they continue refusing, move to Tier 2 quickly. Document their refusal clearly. If they still refuse, this becomes a performance management / termination issue handled through normal HR channels.

### About Tool Requests

**Q: How do we evaluate tool requests quickly?**
A: Create an evaluation rubric: (1) SOC 2 certified? (+20 points); (2) Enterprise version available? (+20 points); (3) Clear business case? (+20 points); (4) No data training on inputs? (+20 points); (5) Used by peer companies? (+20 points). Tools scoring 80+ are fast-tracked; below 40 likely denied.

**Q: Can we just approve everything?**
A: No‚Äîthat defeats the purpose of governance. But you can categorize tools by risk: (1) Low risk (no company data input) = auto-approve; (2) Medium risk (internal data only) = quick review; (3) High risk (confidential data) = thorough evaluation; (4) Critical risk (regulated data) = deny or enterprise-only.

**Q: What if multiple people request the same tool?**
A: Great signal! Prioritize evaluation and consider company-wide license if approved. Bundle multiple requests into one thorough evaluation. Notify all requesters when decision is made.

**Q: Should we charge departments for tool licenses?**
A: Depends on company culture. Chargeback models (departments pay from own budgets) slow adoption but increase accountability. Central funding (IT budget) increases adoption but reduces scrutiny. Hybrid: Central funding for core tools, department funding for specialized tools.

## Final Thoughts: Communication as Culture Change

These templates aren't just emails‚Äîthey're culture change tools.

**68% of employees hide their AI usage.** Why? Because in most companies, AI policy is positioned as restriction, surveillance, and punishment. Employees learn to work around rules they see as arbitrary.

**These templates take a different approach:** Transparent communication about real risks. Clear alternatives that are actually better than unauthorized tools. Progressive discipline that starts with education. A tool request process that says "we want to support your innovation."

**Your goal isn't compliance for compliance's sake.** It's building a culture where employees:
- Understand *why* governance matters (protecting careers, company, and clients)
- Have the *tools they need* to work effectively and safely
- Feel *empowered to ask questions* without fear of punishment
- Know *how to innovate responsibly* within guardrails

These seven templates give you the language to build that culture.

Customize them thoughtfully. Deploy them consistently. Iterate based on feedback.

And remember: The companies that win with AI won't be the ones with the most restrictive policies or the most sophisticated surveillance. They'll be the ones that enable their teams to use AI powerfully, safely, and without fear.

**Your AI governance communication starts now.**
