# The Compliance Quick Check: Multi-Framework AI Compliance Assessment

**Your 50-point self-assessment for GDPR, CCPA, EU AI Act, and SOC 2 | Based on 500+ enterprise audits by Tim Cakir | Last updated: October 2025**

---

## Executive Summary

Here's what we know from 500+ enterprise audits: 63% of organizations have zero AI governance policies, 97% of breached organizations lack proper AI access controls, and organizations with shadow AI face $670,000 higher breach costs. Meanwhile, Italy fined OpenAI €15 million for GDPR violations (under appeal), and the EU AI Act prohibitions are now ACTIVE (since February 2, 2025), with €35M penalty enforcement active since August 2, 2025, and full compliance required by August 2026.

This assessment shows you exactly where you stand across four major compliance frameworks. No judgment, no sales pitch—just clear gaps and practical fixes. Most organizations score 40-65 on their first assessment. The goal is improvement, not perfection.

**What This Assessment Covers:**
- 50 objective compliance checkpoints across GDPR, EU AI Act, SOC 2, and CCPA
- Automated risk scoring (0-100 scale) with gap identification
- Prioritized remediation roadmap with realistic timelines
- Resource requirements and implementation guidance

**The Bottom Line:** EU AI Act fines reach €35M or 7% of revenue (higher than GDPR). GDPR enforcement averages €100M in monthly fines. The compliance gaps you identify today prevent catastrophic penalties tomorrow.

**Time Required:** 30-45 minutes to complete | 45-60 minutes for remediation planning

## How to Use This Assessment

### Assessment Philosophy

This tool is for YOU—not an audit, not a sales pitch. No one sees these results but you. We've seen organizations score everywhere from 15 to 95. Low scores don't mean failure; they mean you now know exactly what to fix and in what order.

### Scoring System

Each question has three possible answers:
- **YES (2 points)**: Control fully implemented and functioning
- **PARTIAL (1 point)**: Control partially implemented or functioning inconsistently
- **NO (0 points)**: Control not implemented or not functioning

**Total Possible Score: 100 points** (50 questions × 2 points maximum)

### Risk Level Interpretation

- **85-100**: Strong Compliance (monitor and maintain)
- **70-84**: Moderate Risk (address high-priority gaps)
- **50-69**: Significant Risk (urgent remediation required)
- **0-49**: Critical Risk (immediate executive action needed)

### How to Answer Honestly

**For "YES" answers, you should be able to:**
- Show documentation of the control
- Demonstrate it's functioning today
- Explain who owns and maintains it
- Prove it covers all relevant systems/data

**Use "PARTIAL" when:**
- Control exists but gaps remain
- Implementation incomplete
- Functioning inconsistently
- Covers some but not all systems

**Choose "NO" when:**
- Control doesn't exist
- Not yet implemented
- Not functioning
- Covers fewer than 50% of relevant systems

### Preparation Tips

**Before starting, gather:**
- List of AI tools currently in use
- Privacy policy and terms of service
- Recent security audit findings (if available)
- Vendor agreements for AI services
- Understanding of where data is processed/stored

**Recommended approach:**
- Involve stakeholders: IT/Security, Legal/Compliance, Executive sponsor
- Set aside uninterrupted time (30-45 minutes)
- Be honest—this helps YOU, not us
- Document specific gaps as you identify them
- Save results for follow-up planning

**Focus:** Critical risk weight items scored "NO" | Immediate regulatory exposure

---

### Action 1: Execute Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with AI Vendors

**Addresses:** GDPR Questions 1-2

**Why This Matters:**
Processing EU personal data without DPAs creates unlawful processing from day one. Italy's €15M OpenAI fine stemmed partially from inadequate processor agreements. Without DPAs, you have no legal framework for vendor data processing.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Inventory AI vendors** processing EU personal data (1-2 hours)
   - List all AI tools accessing EU personal data
   - Identify vendor data processing locations
   - Prioritize by data sensitivity and volume

2. **Request DPAs from vendors** (2-4 hours)

- Liability for vendor data breaches
- Cannot demonstrate compliance in audit

---

### Action 2: Implement Breach Notification Capability (72-Hour Rule)

**Addresses:** GDPR Questions 9-10

**Why This Matters:**
GDPR requires breach notification to supervisory authorities within 72 hours. Missed deadlines create separate violations with additional penalties. No organization plans to have a breach, but 100% of organizations must plan to respond to one.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Document breach detection procedures** (4-6 hours)
   - Define what constitutes a "personal data breach"
   - Identify breach detection mechanisms (alerts, monitoring, user reports)
   - Assign responsibility for breach detection
   - Establish escalation paths

2. **Create breach assessment process** (3-5 hours)

3. **Build notification templates** (4-6 hours)
   - Template for supervisory authority notification (GDPR Article 33)
     * Nature of breach
     * Categories and approximate number of individuals affected
     * Categories and approximate number of records affected
     * Contact point for information
     * Likely consequences
     * Measures taken or proposed to address breach
   - Template for individual notification (GDPR Article 34)
     * Plain language description
     * Contact point for information
     * Likely consequences
     * Measures taken or proposed

4. **Establish 72-hour response timeline** (2-4 hours)
   - Hour 0-4: Breach detection and initial assessment
   - Hour 4-12: Containment and evidence preservation
   - Hour 12-24: Full scope determination
   - Hour 24-48: Notification decision and preparation

   - Evidence supporting classification
   - Review and approval by legal/compliance

5. **Identify compliance obligations by system** (4-6 hours)
   - Prohibited practices: Immediate discontinuation
   - High-risk systems: Full EU AI Act compliance program required
   - Non-high-risk systems: Transparency requirements only
   - Create compliance roadmap by system type

6. **Establish ongoing classification review** (1-2 hours)
   - New AI systems classified before deployment
   - Existing systems reclassified when use cases change
   - Quarterly review of classifications

4. **Define alerting rules** (6-10 hours)
   - Failed authentication threshold (potential brute force)
   - Unusual access patterns (unusual time, location, volume)
   - Privileged access usage
   - Data exfiltration indicators
   - Configuration changes
   - Service availability issues
   - Error rate spikes
   - Set alert severity levels and recipients

5. **Establish log retention** (2-4 hours)
   - Regulatory requirements:
     * SOC 2: Retain logs for audit period (typically 12 months minimum)
     * GDPR: Retain logs for breach investigation (recommendation: 12 months)
     * Industry standards: 12-24 months typical
   - Storage considerations (cost vs. retention)
   - Archive older logs for cost efficiency
   - Budget for log storage costs

6. **Create monitoring dashboard** (4-6 hours)

### Action 9: Configure Consumer Opt-Out Mechanisms (CCPA)

**Addresses:** CCPA Question 46

**Why This Matters:**
If you sell or share personal information (CCPA definitions are broader than traditional understanding), CCPA requires a clear opt-out mechanism. Violations carry up to $7,500 per intentional violation. "Sale" under CCPA includes sharing data with AI vendors for value exchange, not just monetary transactions.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Assess if CCPA "sale/sharing" applies** (4-6 hours)
   - CCPA defines "sale" broadly: "selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating" personal information to third party "for monetary or other valuable consideration"
   - "Sharing" for cross-context behavioral advertising
   - Assess AI vendor relationships:
     * Do AI vendors receive personal information?
     * Is there value exchange (service in exchange for data)?
     * Are there exemptions (service provider, contractor)?

   - Link directs to opt-out mechanism

3. **Create opt-out mechanism** (6-10 hours)
   - Web form for opt-out submission
   - Identity verification (lighter verification for opt-out than access/deletion)
   - Confirmation of opt-out submission
   - Alternative methods (email, phone) may be required
   - Mobile app opt-out mechanism (if applicable)
   - No account creation required for opt-out

4. **Implement Global Privacy Control (GPC)** (4-8 hours)
   - Honor browser-based Global Privacy Control signal
   - Detect GPC signal (opt-out preference signal: Sec-GPC HTTP header)
   - Treat GPC as valid opt-out request
   - Documentation: https://globalprivacycontrol.org/

5. **Build opt-out processing** (8-12 hours)
   - Receive and log opt-out requests
   - Verify and process opt-outs within 15 business days
   - Stop selling/sharing personal information of opted-out consumer
   - Notify third parties (AI vendors) to stop selling/sharing
   - Maintain opt-out status (at least 12 months, prefer indefinite)
   - Provide confirmation to consumer

6. **Update vendor contracts** (4-8 hours)
   - Ensure AI vendor contracts allow for consumer opt-outs
   - Include terms requiring vendor to honor opt-out requests
   - Establish notification process to vendors

   - Treat similarly to GPC

8. **Test and monitor** (2-4 hours)
   - Test opt-out submission process
   - Verify opt-outs are processed within 15 business days
   - Monitor compliance with opt-out requests
   - Quarterly audit of opt-out effectiveness

**Estimated Effort:** 33-57 hours (if sale/sharing applies)

**Required Resources:**
- Legal counsel to assess CCPA sale/sharing applicability
- Web development to add link and opt-out form
- Backend development to process opt-outs
- Vendor coordination to honor opt-outs
- Budget: $3,000-10,000 for development and legal review

**Success Criteria:**
- "Do Not Sell or Share" link visible on website
- Functional opt-out mechanism operational
- GPC signal honored
- Opt-outs processed within 15 business days
- Vendor contracts updated
- Monthly monitoring of opt-out requests

**Risk of Inaction (if sale/sharing applies):**
